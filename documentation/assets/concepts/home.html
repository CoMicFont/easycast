<h1>Main Easycast Concepts</h1>

<p>To get started and use Easycast's full potential, you need to understand a few concepts first</p>

<h2>Cast</h2>

<p>A cast is a composition of assets (images, html pages, video, etc.). Assets are stacked on top
of each other, e.g. to let you use multiple images with transparency.</p>

<h2>Scene</h2>

<p>A scene is a collection of casts, each projected on a particular display. A scene is therefore the
coherent exposition of various images and text on the available displays.</p>

<h2>Display</h2>

<p>Displays are virtual screens. Each display has a unique number and unique web address and presents
a particular cast of a scene at every moment.</p>
